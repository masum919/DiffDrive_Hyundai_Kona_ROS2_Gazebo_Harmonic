# DiffDrive_Hyundai_Kona_ROS2_Gazebo_Harmonic
This package contains a simple example of simulating a differential drive robot with Gazebo Harmonic. The robot model used here is a simple CAD model of a Hyundai Kona. You can use teleop_twist_keyboard or teleop_twist_joy to drive this car around. This package has been built to show how Gazebo Harmonic can be used with ROS2 Jazzy for simulations and Gazebo Harmonic differs quite a bit from the classic Gazebo.
